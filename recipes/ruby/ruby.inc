# This snippet lets compiled extensions which rely on external libraries,
# such as zlib, compile properly.  If we don't do this, then when extmk.rb
# runs, it uses the native libraries instead of the target libraries, and so
# none of the linking operations succeed -- which makes extconf.rb think
# that the libraries aren't available and hence that the extension can't be
# built.
