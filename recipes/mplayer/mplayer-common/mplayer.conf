#
# MPlayer configuration file
#
# Configuration files are read system-wide from /usr/etc/mplayer.conf
# and per user from ~/.mplayer/config, where per-user settings override
# system-wide settings, all of which are overrriden by the command line.
#
# The configuration file settings are the same as the command line
# options without the preceding '-'.
#
# See the CONFIGURATION FILES section in the man page
# for a detailed description of the syntax.
