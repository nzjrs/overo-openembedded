# This patch removes the typedef of __kernel_key_t from
# include/bits/ipc.h.  Because this removes a typedef some
# packages which relied on it (erroneously - it is defined
# in include/linux/posix_types.h and is internal) may stop
# building.  The patch has only been verified on IXP4XX builds.

# ARM thumb interworking - these changes fix various bugs in the
# uclibc implementation of thumb interwork support, but they are
# insufficient on their own - it is also necessary (at present)
# to *disable* the uClibc ARM specific string code (the assembler
# doesn't support interworking).  Since these patches do actually
# change the non-interwork case and make things incompatible with
# older (pre armv4t) ARMs they are condition on the thumb-interwork
# override (i.e. the *distro* has to add this to OVERRIDES).
