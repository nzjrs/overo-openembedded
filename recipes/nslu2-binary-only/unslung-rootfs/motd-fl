   -------- NOTE: RUNNING FROM INTERNAL FLASH  --------

This system is currently running from the internal flash memory,
it has NOT booted up into "unslung" mode from an external drive.

In this mode, very few services are running, and available disk
space is extremely limited.  This mode is normally only used
for initial installation, and system maintenance and recovery.
